# Nuxt + Clean Architecture: a demo repo

## Installation

Requirements: node (recommended to install through [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install
```

and that's it.

## Development
```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# run tests in watch mdoe
$ npm run test:watch

# you can also build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Collaboration

This is a demo repo, so it is meant to evolve as we learn new things and agree upon new practices.
